# plasmid-and-CRISPR-interference

The script CRISPR_vs_plasmid_v3.py is written by Alexander Martynov

For correspondence: alexander.martynov@skolkovotech.ru

Here we developed the mathematical model demonstrating a stochastic nature of interaction between plasmid replication and CRISPR interference rates.

The script is compatible with Python 3.8.

The following libraries are required: scipy, numpy, random, matplotlib, time, os.
